# Project
![Design preview for the Chat app CSS illustration responsive web design project](./designs/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Building the project
* This project was built in [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and uploaded onto [github](https://github.com).
* Google chrome's developer tools were used to check how responsive the project was during the build-up.
* Google lens was used in relation to google search to find the colors.
* When the project was done the deployment website also showed some wrong arrangements in some of the elements and hence reprogramming was done to the codes on github.

* You can [sign up](https://app.netlify.com/signup?) for free and connect it to your github account.
