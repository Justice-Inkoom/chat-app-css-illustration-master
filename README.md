# Project
![Design preview for the Chat app CSS illustration responsive web design project](./designs/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Building the project
This project was built in [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and uploaded onto [github](https://github.com).
Google chrome developer tools were used to check how responsive the project was during the build-up.
Google lens was used in relation to google search to find the colors.
When the project was done the deployment website also showed some wrong arrangement in some of the elements and hence reprogramming was done to the codes on github.
